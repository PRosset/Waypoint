# Waypoint

## Overview
The goal for project two was to buidl a CRUD app using the MEN stack (Mongo, Express, NodeJS). I choose to build a camp site tracking website.

After signing up for the website, you are shown a map with campsite locations (currently just of Georgia campsites). Selecting a campsite on the map will scroll to the campsite card on the left hand side. From that card you can view more details or mark if you have visited there before.
